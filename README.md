## Introduction

This blog was first written in a comparison between two popular static site generators: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I decided to use Gatsby for this blog because it is more suitable for a blog with a lot of static content. Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to generate static HTML pages. It is a great tool for building static websites and blogs. It is also very easy to use and has a lot of plugins and starters to help you get started.

You're are free to use this template for your own blog.

If you're interested in the same template written in GatsbyJS, you can find it [here](https://github.com/richardnguyen99/the-gatsby-paper).
